# Fully-Connected Neural Network (FNN)

The project consists of creating and training a fully connected neural network using PyTorch, tailored for classifying images from the notMNIST dataset. The implementation includes writing a training loop that utilizes cross-entropy loss and the Adam optimization algorithm, as well as developing functions to calculate model accuracy. Acceleration techniques using Metal and CUDA GPUs were applied to enhance the training efficiency and performance. 

The following graphs represent the training accuracy of the model based on the learning rates (0.1, 0.01, 0.001, 0.0001) trained through 50 epoches:
